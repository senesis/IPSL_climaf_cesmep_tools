Notes :
  - all scripts have an inline doc
  - scripts generally receive their parameters as environment variables, but have default values
  - main script also installs a CliMAF version, and provides a version of setenv_C-ESM-EP.sh

Scripts
----------

basic_use.sh : shows the simplest way to use main script, install_all.sh, using a lot of default settings


advanced_use.sh : an example that changes all settings, and is useful for development and tuning


The call treee for the remaining scripts is :
---------------------------------------------
install_all.sh : general driver. Set there almost all parameters. See in-line comments
|
|--> install_env.sh : installer script for the conda environment. CHOOSE THERE THE LIST OF CONDA PACKAGES
     |
     |--> swiss_knife.sh : worker for conda packages installation
	  |
	  |--> test_import_exec.py : worker for testing that python package 'works'
	                             well (be it a python modules or an executable command)
