1- Tools for creating for CliMAF a tested conda environment, a tested
CliMAF install, a module, and a notebook launcher.

2- a tool for creating a Docker container archive of this environment, and to install it on HPC centers
   (note : installing CliMAF and C-ESM-EP at HPC centers is done using scripts push_to_centers
   located in respective code dirs)

3- doc for using this environment with C-ESM-EP on Spirit

1- Scripts for creating the environment
------------------------------------
Notes :
  - all scripts have an inline doc
  - scripts generally receive their parameters as environment variables, but have default values
  - main script is install_all.sh; it also installs and tests a CliMAF version, and provides a version of setenv_C-ESM-EP.sh

test_install.sh : a way to test installing all components, in a test location;
		  it calls install_all.sh (see below)

basic_use.sh : shows the simplest way to use main script, using a lot of default settings,
	       for installing at nominal ('official') locations

advanced_use.sh : an example that changes all settings, and is useful for development and tuning

Call tree for the main script :

install_all.sh : general driver. Set there almost all parameters. See in-line comments.
                 It creates a module, and a notebook script
|
|--> liste_modules.sh : CHOOSE THERE THE LIST OF CONDA PACKAGES
|
|--> swiss_knife.sh : installer script for the conda environment
     |
     |--> test_import_exec.py : worker for testing that python package 'inits'
	                        fine (be it a python module or an executable command)


2- Script for creating a Docker container archive with the environment and CliMAF code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
build_container.sh : script to run on a machine having Docker installed. See doc inline.
