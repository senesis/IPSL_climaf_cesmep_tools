1- Scripts for creating the environment
------------------------------------
Notes :
  - all scripts have an inline doc
  - scripts generally receive their parameters as environment variables, but have default values
  - main script is install_all.sh; it also installs a CliMAF version, and provides a version of setenv_C-ESM-EP.sh

test_install.sh : a way to install all components in a test location

basic_use.sh : shows the simplest way to use main script, using a lot of default settings

advanced_use.sh : an example that changes all settings, and is useful for development and tuning

Call tree for the main script :
install_all.sh : general driver. Set there almost all parameters. See in-line comments.
                 It creates a module, and a notebook-climaf script
|
|--> liste_module.sh : CHOOSE THERE THE LIST OF CONDA PACKAGES
|
|--> swiss_knife.sh : installer script for the conda environment
     |
     |--> test_import_exec.py : worker for testing that python package 'inits'
	                        fine (be it a python module or an executable command)


2- Script for creating a Docker container archive with the environment and CliMAF code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
build_container.sh : script to run on a machine having Docker installed

climaf_spirit_0.tar : result of the script : the container for branch
		      'spirit' of CliMAF, and set '0' of conda packages
		      This (large) file is not included in the repository
