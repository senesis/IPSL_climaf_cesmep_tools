User guide for C-ESM-EP on irene at TGCC
-----------------------------------------

This is a small complement to C-ESM-EP doc. 

Once you have a working account on TGCC, with access to thredds and to IGCMG
tools (such as thredds_cp), you just have to :

- copy a version of C-ESM-EP code that can use pcocc at TGCC; in
  july 2022, this is the case for branch 'spirit'

- in settings.py , set a value for variable 'account' (project
  allocating compute hours)
